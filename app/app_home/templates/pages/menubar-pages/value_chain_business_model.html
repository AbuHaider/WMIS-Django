                        <p>At the very first, a detailed planning of the overall project activities will be made. The plan will include all the required information to implement the sustainable business model. After the planning is conducted, a piloting implementation will be initiated. This will be implemented on a selected area and on small scale in order to understand the whole scenario. After successfully initiating the piloting process, required changes will be made in the planning and it will be implemented in the project area. During the first year, the planning will be executed. During the second year, the whole implementation will be closely monitored in order to find out the lacking. It will be a learning process for the project implementing agency and from the learning best possible solutions will be identified. These solutions will be incorporated in the planning and it will be updated and later it will be re-implemented on the whole project area.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The function of this Sustainable Agro-forestry Hub is expected to be:</p>

                            <ul class="list-group" style="padding-left: 30px !important;">

                                    <p>(1)	Facilitating the application based co-ordination mechanism with community level <b>“Digital facilitator”</b>, Application facilitator will bridge between the local farmers, application, database and the market. The farmers will inform their expected production prior to the harvest to the Digital facilitator.  The facilitator entries the total expected amount of productions to the application, and database. Super shops, wholesalers and individual customers view the production dashboard and farm gate asking price and also place their demand and price expectation.</p>
                                    <p>Urban entrepreneur networks act to expand urban market and also to sell products of different grades to different market strata, especially premium buyers and international buyers.</p>
                                    <p>This entrepreneur network will have their team in the watershed <b>agro-forestry hub</b> and they will monitor the issues pertaining tractability, carbon credit and agricultural best practices.</p>
                                    <p>In between the farmer, <b>Sustainable Agro-forestry Hub</b> and the urban buyers there will be the transport agents and <b>Special Courier services</b>. The transport agents will transport bulk amount of goods to bulk buyers and courier services will transport products for individual consumers. In Bangladesh, in some localities there are special courier services during mango harvest season.</p>
                                    <p><b>Transport agents</b> will receive transportation request from the online application.</p>

                                    <p>(3)	The <b>financing center</b> within the hub will have the facility to transect money using mobile banking and ATM machine. The financing center will have agent from Bank or banks that will convey necessary easy loan facility for the farmers and entrepreneurs.</p>
                                </li>

                        <p>Each Watershed dependent community will have a group headed by the Headman, and assisted by the Karbari(s). The team will also consist of local experts on different sectors based on the land use pattern. The Upazila Agricultural, Livestock, fisheries, and Forest officers/block facilitator will be supervising the Team. The government experts will train (Training of Trainers) these “local experts”. The team will also consist of marketing and outsourcing professionals; those will also be in close contact with Department of Marketing, other government offices, and private companies. The local service provider and regulatory group have another important task, and that is to make fruitful coordination among different actors at heterogeneous layers in a value chain from community level, that is doing vertical linkage effective.</p>
                        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Local expert Service provider and regulatory group</h5> 
                        <p>In this concept, each Watershed dependent community will have a group headed by the Headman, DAM and DAE. The Headman will create community linkages along with all other stakeholders and aspects. Department of Agriculture Marketing will be responsible for the whole value chain management related support among the communities. Department of Agriculture Extension will be in-charge of environmental monitoring. DAM and DAE will arrange seminars, workshops and trainings for the communities in coordination with the Headman. The rest of the stakeholders will work directly in the community for the business model management. The Karbari will act as a manager field level in order to create linkages among all the stakeholders. Women farmer representative will ensure active participation of the women participants. The local trained farmer will be also knowns as smart farmer and the experts will train them. It is also known as the <b>Training for the Trainers (TOT)</b>. An App facilitator will be selected from the each water shed and he/she will be trained properly. The app facilitator/ICT Expert will be in-charge of maintaining all the product related activity and record keeping for traceability such as receiving orders, receiving products from farmer, updating product details, receiving farmers queries and output forecast and more. Local and outsource agents will outsource different buyers. They will also create linkages among different level buyers. An urban entrepreneur will manage the urban entrepreneur network and his/her task will be managing the business at urban level. </p>

                        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Community cooperatives</h5> 
                        <p>Community cooperative(s) will be formed. The cooperatives will be consist of marginal actors from different layers in the agro-forestry production scheme- such as, farmers/producers/harvesters group or association.  The rationale for that is, the farmers have week horizontal linkage- that is interpersonal relation with other farmers. Due to lack of <b>horizontal linkage</b>, their negotiation power in the market is weak. By increasing community cooperatives among the farmers, harvesters or other marginal group, their negotiation power will rise in the market.</p>
                        

                        <i><u><h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Community Engagement</h4></u></i> 
                        <p>For any development programs, engagement of the community is one of the most important components. Effective community participation is highly required to bring out the best outcome from any development program. The agro-forestry business model in the CHT region is mainly targeted towards the local communities and their active engagement is incomparable. Also all the other stakeholders in the community also needs to be engaged in order to get a sustainable and positive result. The Para collection point also will be known, as the Digital Information Hub will play an important in community engagement. This hub will be one of the main source of connecting the entire stakeholder involved in the business.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-12 text-center mb-3"><label class="mx-auto">Figure: Different Level Community Engagement via Para Collection Point</label></div>
                        <p>The farmers/producers in the region will be directly connected with other stakeholders with the help of the hub. The hub will also arrange workshops, seminars, trainings for the community. In corporation with public and private organizations, the hub will arrange seminars, workshops for the community people to encourage them to be involve in the agro-forestry business. The community leaders will also be encouraged to actively engage in the process as they can play a vital role in the development.</p>


                        <i><u><h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Gender and Youth Engagement Strategies</h4></u></i>
                        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Women Engagement</h5> 
                        <p>Food production, processing, marketing, and distribution are just a few of the tasks that women and youth participate in within food value chains, making them essential to the operation of food systems. Compared to the other parts of the country, gender and youth engagement in livelihood generation related activities are higher. As a result, more effective and active engagement of gender and youth needs to be ensured for maximum positive results. A baseline condition of women and youth involvement in different product in Ghilachari is shown below.</p>
