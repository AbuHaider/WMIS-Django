                                        Climate-Resilient Livelihood Improvement and Watershed Management in Chittagong Hill Tracts Sector Project. This proposed project will improve climate resilient livelihoods and access to basic services for rural communities living in the three hill districts of Bandarban, Khagrachari and Rangamati of the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT) region, a remote and relatively under-developed region of Bangladesh. The project will adopt a holistic approach of addressing deficiencies in financial, human, physical, natural, and social capital that are needed to support sustainable and resilient community development.

                                    <p>
                                        Specifically, the project will (i) develop small-scale community infrastructure; (ii) improve watershed protection and management; (iii) improve agricultural production, processing, and marketing; (iv) improve non-farm skills amongst rural youth and strengthen capacity of CHT institutions; and (v) improve rural road connectivity
                                    </p>

                                        The project will explicitly support climate resilient outcomes and build long-term resilience of the institutional systems that it supports, in one of the most socially disadvantaged and highly vulnerable regions of Bangladesh.
                                    </p>

                                        The project is aligned with the government's 8FYP, which aims to reduce poverty in lagging regions through investments in rural roads, rural water supply and sanitation, irrigation and agriculture, rural enterprise development, community forest management, promoting sustainable development, and minimizing climate related challenges. The project also supports the strengthening of CHT institutions, empowerment of women, inclusion of ethnic communities in development, and partnerships with civil society organizations.

                                The project compliments the programs of several other development partners engaged in the CHT. The project is also aligned with the objectives of: (i) the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100; and (ii) the Nationally Determined Contributions 2021 of Bangladesh. Within ADB, the project aligns with: (i) several operational priorities of ADB's Strategy 2030; and (ii) the Country Partnership Strategy for Bangladesh 2021-2025, specifically, strategic objective 2: promote green growth and climate resilience; and strategic objective 3: strengthening human capital and social protection

                                The project will ensure participation of community men and women, including the poor and disadvantaged groups. The project will strengthen participation through (i) inclusion of the poor and women as members of different committees; (ii) developing demand driven subproject selection by separate consultation with men and women groups consisting of various economic groups; and (iii) inclusion of community people as skilled and unskilled labors in the infrastructure related works. All relevant stakeholders, including the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council, the three Hill District Councils, circle chiefs, the Local Government Engineering Department, traditional village leaders (karbaris and headmen), district and Union Council chairpersons and members, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) working in the project location will be consulted. Stakeholders will be involved in the design of the community infrastructure and basic services.
